# trial

What to do for this milestone:
• To implement the text-based game.
• To document your code.

What to submit (by each group)
In the same Github repo that you set up in Stage 1, create a README.MD file in the repo that contains:
▪ Identification of the team members.
▪ A description of your game and introduce the game rules.
▪ A list of features that you have implemented, and explain how each coding element 1 to 5 listed under the coding requirements aforementioned support your features.
▪ A list of non-standard C/C++ libraries, if any, that are used in your work and integrated to your code repo. Please also indicate what features in your game are supported by these libraries.
▪ Compilation and execution instructions. This serves like a "Quick start" of your game. The teaching team will follow your instructions to compile and run your
game.
Your code including the makefile and all source files (.h / .cpp / .c)
Submit a link to the repo to Moodle. (Refer to the details in the submission page)
A video (at most 3 minutes long) demonstrating a gameplay and the implemented features of your program.
• You can either submit a link to video or upload it to Moodle.
• Video clips after 3 mins would be ignored if your demo is longer than 3 mins.

What to submit (by each individual student)
Submit on Moodle (Refer to the details in the submission page)
• a list of work that you have done for the project
• a peer evaluation to your project partners in your group.
• To declare your own contribution if the Contributions Graph in GitHub does not reflect the real contribution distribution.
